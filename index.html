        <h2>Throughout my Computer Science degree program, I have advanced from learning fundamental principles to demonstrating professional-level competencies in software development. My journey involved not only understanding algorithms, data structures, and secure coding practices but also refining my ability to communicate technical concepts, collaborate effectively, and design user-focused experiences. The artifacts presented in this portfolio, alongside the enhancements I have implemented, are a testament to how my coursework, hands-on projects, and iterative refinement have prepared me to enter the field with confidence and versatility.</h2>
