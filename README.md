# Christopher Carnell's Portfolio

Welcome to my Computer Science ePortfolio! This repository hosts the source code and supporting files for my professional portfolio, showcasing the projects, enhancements, and skills I developed during my Computer Science degree program.

## Overview

This portfolio is presented as a single-page website, accessible at [https://cscarnell.github.io/](https://cscarnell.github.io/). Visitors will find:

- **Professional Self-Assessment:**  
  An introduction to my journey through the CS program, the skills Iâ€™ve developed, and my readiness for professional work.
  
- **Code Review Video:**  
  A recorded walkthrough of the original code, detailing my initial analysis and the rationale behind subsequent enhancements.
  
- **Enhancements Section:**  
  A comparative display of original and improved code artifacts, including code snippets, explanations of improvements, and direct links to the full code in this repository.
  
- **Narratives and Additional Resources:**  
  Detailed write-ups for each enhancement, user-friendly navigation, and resources that illustrate my growth and capabilities as a developer.

## Artifacts and Enhancements

This portfolio centers on an Android-based weight-tracking application. Each artifact demonstrates key competencies, including:

- **Software Engineering and Design:**  
  Refactoring code for maintainability, adding meaningful documentation, and implementing robust error handling.

- **Algorithms and Data Structures:**  
  Optimizing data retrieval, insertion logic, and sorting strategies to improve performance and scalability.

- **Database Management:**  
  Enforcing data integrity, leveraging foreign keys and indexes, ensuring proper resource handling, and integrating caching mechanisms.
